- DBMS Instance => Collection of memory components and multiple background process and each background process are independent of one another.

- OS Background Process for DBMS =>  -Database Writer 
 									 -Checkpoint Process 
 									 -System Monitor 
 									 -Process Monitor
 									 -Archvie Process
 									 -Server Process
 									 -Recoverer
 									 -Log Writer

- Database always associated with single Instance however you can have multiple instances of same type but on differet nodes (uses RAC- Real Application Cluster - mutliple same instances on many nodes).

- Data Dictionary or meta data or System Tables are tables which contain data for data.

- Actual data is called as User Tables.

- Some Important Terms => - Relation: a Table
						  - Tuple: a row in table
						  - Attribute: a colun in table
						  - Degree: number of attributes
						  - Cardinality: number of tuples
						  - PrimaryKey: a unique identifier
						  - Domain: a pool of values from which specific attributes of specific 	relations draw theor values

- SQL has components -> Data Definition Language
						Transcation Control Language
						Data Manipulation language 

- Behind the scenes DBMS has: - Query Engine - responsible for processing sql statement
							  - Query Optimizer - create execution plans
							  - Storge management - maintaince of storage of data
							  - Transcation Managment - part of DML attributes	

- Any statment in SQL is called Query.

- Clause(eg: INSERT) tells DBMS to join two things.

- VALUES is keyword.

- Transcation: sequence of statements that will be executed, Transcations have ACID properties:
				- A = atomicity   (a transcation should be done or undone completely)
				- C = consistency (every transcation make it consisent)
				- I = isolation   (each transcation should work indepenedent)
				- D = durability  (complete transcation should remain permanent)

- Overview of Database design : - Conceptual Design
								- Schema Normalization
								- Physical Database Design and tuning

- ER(Entity Relationship) has three main components: - Entity
													 - Attribute 
													 - Relationship

- Entity can be an person,object.	

- Relationship describes relation between entites represented by diamonds.

- Weak entity are dependednt on other entites.

- Multivalued attribute are attributes which contains multiple values in the same column / subcolumns.

- Table within a table -> nested table similarly nested column.

- Generalization is a bottom-up approach in which two lower level entities combine to form a higher level entity.

- Specialization in which higher level entity broken down into several entities.

- OLTP - fast response - prod
  OLAP - correct output - data minning

- Use High Slecetive column for splitting the tables.

- username : sys as sysdb
  password: orcl

- desc command to see structure of table, meta data table names end with 's'.

- schema name(logical entity name) and username(physical entity name) will always be same.

- show user - tells which user is currently accessing

- identifies is used to chnage the password of any account 

- select USERNAME,CREATED,ACCOUNT_STATUS from dba_users;
	alter user hr identified by hr account unlock;

- inorder to connect to remote database use username/password@remote_database_name

- meta data table names -  User 		  - user_xyz
								  			All_xyz
						   dba/SYS/SYSTEM - dba_xyz
						   				  - V$xyz
